Any element at an odd index can be preserved until the end. Since each element at an odd index has an even number of elements on both sides, pairs of adjacent elements can be removed from left to right until only the element at the odd index remains. For example, if you want to keep the element at the $$$i$$$-th position, you can remove the elements at positions $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$, and so on, until the elements at positions $$$i-2$$$ and $$$i-1$$$ are removed.

The problem is that we have an array of odd length, and we can repeatedly remove pairs of adjacent elements until there's one left. We need to find the maximum possible remaining element after all possible operations.\\n\\nHmm. Let's think about the process. Each operation removes two adjacent elements. Since the array length is odd, after each operation the length decreases by 1 (because 2 are removed, so the new length is n-2 + ... wait, no. Wait, when you remove two adjacent elements, the array's length reduces by 2 each time. Wait, the original array length is n, which is odd. Then after each operation, the length becomes n-2, which is odd minus 2, which is even? Wait no, wait. Wait, n is odd. For example, if n is 3, after removing two elements, the length is 1. Which is odd. Wait, so each operation reduces the length by 2. So the parity of the length remains odd. Because subtracting 2 from an odd number gives another odd number. Wait, no. Wait 3-2=1 (odd), 1-2=-1, which is not possible. So the process stops when the length is 1. So for the starting n which is odd, after each operation the length is n-2, which is again odd, until it reaches 1.\\n\\nSo the process will take (n-1)/2 steps. Because each step removes two elements, so (n-1)/2 steps to get from n to 1.\\n\\nBut how to model which elements can be kept. The key is to find a selection of elements where each step removes two adjacent elements, and the remaining elements form a possible path of removal steps leading to that element being the last one.\\n\\nWait, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's look at the examples.\\n\\nIn the second test case: 3 elements. The options are to remove the first two, leaving the third, or remove the last two, leaving the first. So the maximum is the maximum of the first or third element. But in the example given, the array is [1,3,2]. The options are 2 or 1, so maximum is 2. But the third element is 2. Wait, so that's the case. So for n=3, the maximum is the maximum of the elements at positions 0, 2 (assuming 0-based indexing). Because after removing the first two, you get the third. Or removing the last two, you get the first.\\n\\nWait, that's interesting. So for n=3, the last remaining element can be either the first or the third. So the maximum is the maximum of those two.\\n\\nWhat about n=5. Let's take the third example: [4,7,4,2,9]. The solution was 9, which is the fifth element. How did that happen? Let's see the steps. They first removed 7 and 4 (the second and third elements), leading to [4,2,9]. Then in that array, they removed 4 and 2, leading to 9. So the final element is the fifth element of the original array.\\n\\nAlternatively, for a 5-element array, maybe the possible elements that can remain are those at positions 0, 2, 4. Because when you start with 5 elements, after each removal step, you have 3, then 1. So maybe the positions that are even indices in the original array can be the ones that are kept.\\n\\nWait, perhaps the answer is that the maximum element among the elements at the even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) is the answer. Because when you have an array of odd length, each time you remove two adjacent elements, the remaining elements' positions depend on which pair was removed.\\n\\nWait, for example, in the 5-element array. Let's say the array is a0, a1, a2, a3, a4. If you remove a1 and a2, then the remaining array is a0, a3, a4. Then, in the next step, you can remove a0 and a3 (leaving a4), or a3 and a4 (leaving a0). So in this path, the final element is a4 or a0.\\n\\nAlternatively, if you first remove a3 and a4, then the remaining array is a0, a1, a2. Then next step removes a0 and a1, leaving a2. So the final element is a2.\\n\\nAnother possibility: first remove a0 and a1, leaving a2, a3, a4. Then next step removes a3 and a4, leaving a2. So the final element is a2.\\n\\nSo for a 5-element array, the possible final elements are a0, a2, a4. So the maximum is the maximum of these three.\\n\\nIf that's the case, then for the third example in the input, the elements at even indices (0,2,4) are 4,4,9. The maximum is 9, which matches the sample output.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the fourth example, the input array is [3,1,4,1,5,9,2] (n=7). The even indices are 0,2,4,6. The elements are 3,4,5,2. The maximum is 5, which matches the sample output.\\n\\nAnother sample is the second test case (n=3): even indices 0 and 2. Elements are 1 and 2. Max is 2.\\n\\nSo this seems to fit all the examples.\\n\\nSo the solution is: for the array of odd length n, the maximum possible remaining element is the maximum among all elements at even indices (0-based). Because those are the positions that could end up as the last element after removing pairs in a certain way.\\n\\nWait, why is that the case? Let's think recursively. For an array of length 1, the only element is the answer. For an array of length 3, you can remove the first two elements (leaving the third) or the last two (leaving the first). So the answer is max of first and third. For length 5, the possible elements that can be left are the first, third, fifth elements, because each step of removing pairs can leave the even positions.\\n\\nBut how to see this pattern holds for any odd n?\\n\\nHmm. Let's think for n=5. The possible elements that can be left after all operations are the elements at positions 0, 2, 4.\\n\\nSimilarly, for n=7, the possible elements are 0, 2,4,6.\\n\\nSo the pattern is that the positions that can be the last element are those with even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., n-1). Because when you remove pairs, the even indices can be preserved.\\n\\nWait, but how exactly? For example, in the 5-element array, how can a2 be preserved?\\n\\nIn the example where you first remove a3 and a4, then the array is a0, a1, a2. Then you can remove a0 and a1, leaving a2. So in that case, a2 is the last element.\\n\\nSo the key insight is that when you remove pairs in such a way that certain elements are skipped, you can end up with any even index element as the last remaining.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is simply the maximum value among the elements at even positions (0, 2, 4, ...) in the original array.\\n\\nSo the solution is to iterate over all elements in even indices and find the maximum.\\n\\nThat's a very simple solution. So the code would be, for each test case, read the array, iterate through the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.), and take the maximum.\\n\\nLet me check the samples again.\\n\\nFirst sample: n=1. The only element is at index 0, which is even. So answer is 6. Correct.\\n\\nSecond sample: n=3. Indices 0 and 2. Max of 1 and 2 is 2. Correct.\\n\\nThird sample: n=5. Indices 0, 2,4. Values 4,4,9. Max 9. Correct.\\n\\nFourth sample: n=7. Indices 0,2,4,6. Values 3,4,5,2. Max 5. Correct.\\n\\nYes, all the samples are covered by this approach.\\n\\nSo the problem reduces to selecting the maximum element from the even indices of the array.\\n\\nTherefore, the code is straightforward. Read t test cases. For each, read n, then the array. Then loop through the array, check the elements at even indices (i=0,2,4,...,n-1), and take the maximum.\\n\\nThat's it. So this solution should work.\\n\\nSo the code would be:\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n\\nRead n.\\n\\nRead the array a.\\n\\nInitialize max_val to a[0].\\n\\nThen for i from 2 to n-1, stepping by 2:\\n\\nif a[i] > max_val, update max_val.\\n\\nThen output max_val.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow let's write the code.\\n\\nIn C++, the steps would be:\\n\\nRead t.\\n\\nLoop t times:\\n\\nRead n.\\n\\nRead n integers into a vector.\\n\\nInitialize the maximum as a[0].\\n\\nLoop i from 2 to n-1, step 2 (i += 2):\\n\\nCompare and update the maximum.\\n\\nPrint the maximum.\\n\\nWait, for n=1, the loop runs from 2 to 0, which is not executed. So the maximum remains a[0], which is correct.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo the code would look like:\\n\\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\nint main() {\\n    int t;\\n    cin >> t;\\n    while (t--) {\\n        int n;\\n        cin >> n;\\n        vector<int> a(n);\\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\\n            cin >> a[i];\\n        }\\n        int max_val = a[0];\\n        for (int i=2; i <n; i +=2) {\\n            if (a[i] > max_val) {\\n                max_val = a[i];\\n            }\\n        }\\n        cout << max_val << endl;\\n    }\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n\\nTesting this code against the samples.\\n\\nSample 1:\\n\\nInput:\\n\\n4\\n\\n1\\n\\n6\\n\\nOutput 6.\\n\\nSample 2:\\n\\n3\\n\\n1 3 2.

The maximum is 9, which matches the sample output.\\n\\nSimilarly, in the fourth example, the input array is [3,1,4,1,5,9,2] (n=7). The even indices are 0,2,4,6. The elements are 3,4,5,2. The maximum is 5, which matches the sample output.\\n\\nAnother sample is the second test case (n=3): even indices 0 and 2. Elements are 1 and 2. Max is 2.\\n\\nSo this seems to fit all the examples.\\n\\nSo the solution is: for the array of odd length n, the maximum possible remaining element is the maximum among all elements at even indices (0-based). Because those are the positions that could end up as the last element after removing pairs in a certain way.\\n\\nWait, why is that the case? Let's think recursively. For an array of length 1, the only element is the answer. For an array of length 3, you can remove the first two elements (leaving the third) or the last two (leaving the first). So the answer is max of first and third. For length 5, the possible elements that can be left are the first, third, fifth elements, because each step of removing pairs can leave the even positions.\\n\\nBut how to see this pattern holds for any odd n?\\n\\nHmm. Let's think for n=5. The possible elements that can be left after all operations are the elements at positions 0, 2, 4.\\n\\nSimilarly, for n=7, the possible elements are 0, 2,4,6.\\n\\nSo the pattern is that the positions that can be the last element are those with even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., n-1). Because when you remove pairs, the even indices can be preserved.\\n\\nWait, but how exactly? For example, in the 5-element array, how can a2 be preserved?\\n\\nIn the example where you first remove a3 and a4, then the array is a0, a1, a2. Then you can remove a0 and a1, leaving a2. So in that case, a2 is the last element.\\n\\nSo the key insight is that when you remove pairs in such a way that certain elements are skipped, you can end up with any even index element as the last remaining.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is simply the maximum value among the elements at even positions (0, 2, 4, ...) in the original array.\\n\\nSo the solution is to iterate over all elements in even indices and find the maximum.\\n\\nThat's a very simple solution. So the code would be, for each test case, read the array, iterate through the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.), and take the maximum.\\n\\nLet me check the samples again.\\n\\nFirst sample: n=1. The only element is at index 0, which is even. So answer is 6. Correct.\\n\\nSecond sample: n=3. Indices 0 and 2. Max of 1 and 2 is 2. Correct.\\n\\nThird sample: n=5. Indices 0, 2,4. Values 4,4,9. Max 9. Correct.\\n\\nFourth sample: n=7. Indices 0,2,4,6. Values 3,4,5,2. Max 5. Correct.\\n\\nYes, all the samples are covered by this approach.\\n\\nSo the problem reduces to selecting the maximum element from the even indices of the array.\\n\\nTherefore, the code is straightforward. Read t test cases. For each, read n, then the array. Then loop through the array, check the elements at even indices (i=0,2,4,...,n-1), and take the maximum.\\n\\nThat's it. So this solution should work.\\n\\nSo the code would be:\\n\\nFor each test case:\\n\\nRead n.\\n\\nRead the array a.\\n\\nInitialize max_val to a[0].\\n\\nThen for i from 2 to n-1, stepping by 2:\\n\\nif a[i] > max_val, update max_val.\\n\\nThen output max_val.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nNow let's write the code.\\n\\nIn C++, the steps would be:\\n\\nRead t.\\n\\nLoop t times:\\n\\nRead n.\\n\\nRead n integers into a vector.\\n\\nInitialize the maximum as a[0].\\n\\nLoop i from 2 to n-1, step 2 (i += 2):\\n\\nCompare and update the maximum.\\n\\nPrint the maximum.\\n\\nWait, for n=1, the loop runs from 2 to 0, which is not executed. So the maximum remains a[0], which is correct.\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nSo the code would look like:\\n\\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\nint main() {\\n    int t;\\n    cin >> t;\\n    while (t--) {\\n        int n;\\n        cin >> n;\\n        vector<int> a(n);\\n        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {\\n            cin >> a[i];\\n        }\\n        int max_val = a[0];\\n        for (int i=2; i <n; i +=2) {\\n            if (a[i] > max_val) {\\n                max_val = a[i];\\n            }\\n        }\\n        cout << max_val << endl;\\n    }\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n\\nTesting this code against the samples.\\n\\nSample 1:\\n\\nInput:\\n\\n4\\n\\n1\\n\\n6\\n\\nOutput 6.\\n\\nSample 2:\\n\\n3\\n\\n1 3 2. The even indices are 0 and 2. Values 1 and 2. Max is 2.\\n\\nSample3:\\n\\n5\\n\\n4 7 4 2 9. Even indices 0,2,4. Values 4,4,9. Max is9.\\n\\nSample4:\\n\\n7\\n\\n3 1 4 1 5 9 2. Even indices 0 (3), 2 (4), 4 (5), 6 (2). Max is 5.\\n\\nAll correct.\\n\\nSo this code should pass all test cases.\\n\\nThus, the solution is to take the maximum among elements at even indices.\\n</think>\\n\\n```cpp\\n#include <bits/stdc++.h>\\nusing namespace std;\\n\\nint main() {\\n    int t;\\n    cin >> t;\\n    while (t--) {\\n        int n;\\n        cin >> n;\\n        vector<int> a(n);\\n        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {\\n            cin >> a[i];\\n        }\\n        int max_val = a[0];\\n        for (int i = 2; i < n; i += 2) {\\n            if (a[i] > max_val) {\\n                max_val = a[i];\\n            }\\n        }\\n        cout << max_val << '\\\\n';\\n    }\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\", 'role': 'assistant'}]}\n"

      "Okay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of points where two lines intersect. The lines are given by their equations A1x + B1y + C1 = 0 and A2x + B2y + C2 = 0. Hmm, right. So I remember that two lines can either be parallel (no intersection), coinciding (infinite points), or intersect at exactly one point.\n",

      "So the steps here are to determine which case we're in. But how do I compute that?\n",

      "First, the lines could be the same line. That would mean all their coefficients are proportional. But wait, there's a catch when C is involved. Like, if A1, B1, C1 are all multiples of A2, B2, C2 by the same factor, then they are the same line. But if the C terms don't scale the same as A and B, then they're parallel but different.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe I should approach this by checking the determinant. The standard approach is to compute the determinant of the coefficients matrix. For two lines a1x + b1y + c1 =0 and a2x + b2y + c2 =0, the system has:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Exactly one solution if the determinant (a1*b2 - a2*b1) is not zero. So that's the case where the lines intersect at one point.\n",
      "- If the determinant is zero, then they are either parallel (no solution) or coinciding (infinite solutions).\n",
      "\n",
      "But how to check if they're coinciding when the determinant is zero? Because the lines could be the same line even if the equations look different. For example, 2x + 2y + 2 =0 is the same as x + y + 1 =0. So the coefficients are proportional, including the constants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but in the equation Ax + By + C =0, if you multiply all coefficients by a non-zero constant, you get the same line. So to check if two lines are the same, you need to check if there's a non-zero scalar k such that A1 = k*A2, B1 = k*B2, C1 = k*C2. But how to handle this in code, especially with possible zero coefficients?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, when the determinant is zero, the lines are parallel or coinciding. To check if they are the same line, perhaps substitute a point from one line into the other. But how to avoid division by zero? Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, when the determinant (a1*b2 - a2*b1) is zero, the lines are parallel. Then, check if the equations are scalar multiples of each other. If they are, then infinite solutions; else, no solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the steps would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Compute the determinant D = A1*B2 - A2*B1.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. If D is not zero: there's exactly one intersection point. So output 1.\n",

      "\n",
      "   b. Else, output 0 (no points).\n",
      "\n",
      "So the crux is how to check if the two lines are the same when D is zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "But how to check that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another way: when the lines are parallel (D=0), they are the same line if and only if the equations are scalar multiples of each other, including the constant term. So (A1, B1, C1) and (A2, B2, C2) must be proportional. But how to check this?\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's see. Let's suppose that all coefficients are zero. Wait, but the input lines are valid equations. So for example, if A1, B1, C1 are all zero, then the equation 0x +0y +0 =0 is all the plane. But in the problem statement, perhaps the equations are such that they are lines. Wait, the problem states that the two sets are determined by the equations. But if the equation is 0x + 0y +0=0, then all points are in the set. Similarly, if it's 0x+0y +5=0, then there's no solution (since 5=0 is impossible). So the problem's input may have lines or invalid equations. Oh, but in the problem statement, the first set is determined by the equation, but that might not necessarily form a line. Wait, but for the problem's purpose, perhaps the equations are such that the two sets are lines. But the problem's input may have coefficients that lead to equations that are not lines. For example, 0 0 1: 0x +0y +1=0 → no points. So in this case, the intersection is between two sets that are empty, so the intersection is empty. So 0 points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, this complicates things. Because the problem's input may not represent lines. So the first step is to check whether each equation represents a valid line.\n",
      "\n",
      "So first, for each equation, we need to determine if it's a line. For the equation A x + B y + C =0, it's a line if and only if A and B are not both zero. Otherwise, if A and B are both zero:\n",
      "\n",
      "   - If C is zero: then the equation is 0=0, which is always true. So the set is all points. So the line is the entire plane.\n",
      "\n",
      "   - If C is non-zero: the equation is impossible (like 0=5), so the set is empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in the problem, the two equations can represent lines, the entire plane, or nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the possible cases are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Case 1: Both equations represent the entire plane. Then their intersection is the entire plane → infinite points → output -1.\n",

      "\n",
      "Case 6: Both equations are lines. Then check if they are the same line, parallel, or intersecting. Then output accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, this adds a lot of complexity. So first, we need to determine for each equation whether it's a line, the entire plane, or an empty set.\n",

      "Then, the intersection of the two sets depends on their types.\n",

      "1. For each equation, determine its type:\n",
